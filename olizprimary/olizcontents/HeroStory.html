I’ve turned it over a million times in my head how it is that none of these ideas or urges of mine fit into any of the system’s virtue boxes. It’s not that the system has failed to educate me because I understand clearly: virtue is the bravery to fight in war, the humility to completely neglect anything aside from the collective, the honesty of submitting your weekly canvas, and the intelligence to follow the system’s rules. Virtue is conformity and agreement to everything the system tells us, and that the authority enforces. The authority is protecting us. I know exactly what to put on the canvases to please them and I know how to do right, but I don’t understand why it makes me so uncomfortable to do so. Or well… I didn’t until the day that I lost my mind. Now I really know I’m screwed.  
</p><p>
In this system, rising 12th years are to be specialized to fit their dominant virtue. We’ve been taught all our lives about the virtues, and how exactly to produce for the system. The system issues out one canvas per week that we fill, matched to a template, to represent our virtuous urges. Canvases are a valuable tool that we gratefully accept and fill to prove that our education is working and that we’re virtuous… of course. Anyone that doesn’t turn in their canvas or fails to fit the template is abandoned; useless. The specialization ceremony is where we present our final canvas to the authority- to the world. And for me, it’s tomorrow. Our final canvas is supposed to be a representation of all that we have learned from the systems education, or all that we are in their eyes. And well basically I messed up. 
</p><p>
The day that I lost my mind was actually just the other day when I found all this canvas that I’m spewing on now. I also found some of these little sticks that seem to make me hallucinate, seeing all of the color of the world a little bit brighter. I’ve never seen such a thing… I must really be going mad. It’s curious that now I’m a no-good delusional mess, producing all of this that’s wrong in the sake of nothing to do with virtue. In the sake of what? I don’t know. It feels like there’s something there. It’s curious that I’ve never felt better, aside from the impending doom of the specialization ceremony. It’s curious that I’m more-so dreading running out of canvas to defile than being abandoned… whatever that even means. I think I’ve always sort of felt like I needed this. I’ve always felt wrong despite being able to produce right for the system. I’ve always felt so foggy and empty, like I’ve had no sense of continuity or clarity with myself or the world around me. Jeez, if the authority knew what went through my head now. Now that I have this canvas and this idea of having a “self” or any sort of coherence within the world well… now I don’t really know what to do. Now, I feel like I’ve opened a portal to a paradoxical world of everything wrong that feels so much better than anything that the system ever told me was right… and I can’t let it go.

Jane is the least virtuous girl I’ve ever met in my life. She tends to make me feel like I’ve screwed everything up anyways, so maybe she could help me out. No, that wouldn’t work. It seems so impossible that I could find any help in someone who’s a part of that virtuous system… but she’s- 
</p><p>
“Jane!” I exclaim as she barges in. “What’re you doing here!?” 
</p><p>
“John!” she gasped. “I could ask you the same. No… please don’t tell me. No John, no! This is wrong and you know it.” My efforts to hide the scattered mess of delusion and iniquity were futile. I realize it’s too late now. 
</p><p>
“No no wait I can explain!” Despite her visible trembling and the terror in her voice, she seems almost as curious as I am about the whole mess. I got the inexplicable sense that she was harmless here amidst the evidence of my painfully cataclysmic production. 
</p><p>
“What is this one?” she inclined with a whisper. She walks over to pick up a canvas that I had filled entirely with those hallucinatory sticks. I had filled it with pattern, imitation, and a physical manifestation of what felt like this newfound sense of self. I filled it without thinking of the system for the first time in my life. Filled it with the insanity that fueled the perverse relief that I felt upon discovering this outlet for… something. 
</p><p>
“I-I’ve seen that before. I know it. Well except I haven’t but I’ve… I’ve felt it before I swear!” 
</p><p>
“What do you mean you’ve felt it? I never showed you before and… well dammit I just explained it to you and you said I was wrong!” 
</p><p>
“No you did not! You just showed me how you’re no good for the system and completely delusional in the head! But that’s different… well no it’s not it just never made sense to me like that before and I guess I’d never seen it so clearly… clearly though I guess it’s somewhat abstract and absolutely obscure I just-” 
</p><p>
“Well spit it out what are you getting at!?” 
</p><p>
“I just thought I was alone all along! It’s hard to articulate and impossible to speak to anyone in the system about such a thing. I-I don’t know you’re just bizarre John… but I get it. I really do. And I don’t think I ever would have so clearly had you not made that mess on that canvas. What a mess! It feels so different, yet comfortable. It’s horrible! I’ve never seen it before, but I’ve felt it. It’s… it’s something I don’t understand, and it hurts my head to try! Why would you ever make such a thing?”  
</p><p>
“It’s beauty, I think.” I reflexively blurted despite never having heard that word out loud in any sort of sensible context. 
</p><p>
“John!” she gasped “Lower your voice, you know that’s an abandoned word. W-well what is beauty anyways?” 
</p><p>
“Dammit Jane I don’t know! If that’s not beauty, then I don’t know what is! It’s everything that the system suppresses. It’s why everything feels so empty- the lack of it. And I think it’s inside all of us! If you can feel it and I can make it out of nothing despite everything in the world telling me it’s wrong. If it feels this good... If we have each other then… then maybe we’re not alone. Maybe this could fix it all.” 
</p><p>
“Well, what are we gonna do? It never seemed possible to me that the world- the system- even needed fixing before I saw that.” Something seemed to have changed in Jane. The way she talks now is like I’ll never be alone again. She’s beautiful. Beauty… beauty and love. I think I could love Jane. Whatever that means. “I wish the world could see it. Then, maybe things would be different. I wanna live in a world full of beauty.” 
</p><p>
“Jane, that’s it! The specialization ceremony. W-we can show the world!” 
</p><p>
“We’ll be abandoned. You know it.” 
</p><p>
“I don’t wanna live in a world without beauty. I’ll be abandoned or I’ll die. I don’t care.” 
</p><p>
“I’m willing to try if you are.” she said in a way that seemed to light the world on fire. 
</p><p>
“Beauty will save the world Jane, I swear it.”  
</p><p>
“You’re bizarre, John.”
