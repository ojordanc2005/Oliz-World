“So, the past couple of years have been pretty crazy huh?” asked my childhood friend with that familiar grin. I haven’t seen her since graduation, the day before I left home. </p> 
<p>
“Jeez, I don’t even know where to start.” I wasn’t lying, despite that it felt as though I’d been waiting to have this conversation since I left. “It’s been awesome. The past 2 years have felt like a lifetime, and I’m only 24.” 
</p><p>
“Well go on then. Shoot!” she nudged. 
</p><p>
“Well, shoot! You know how I am… It was smooth sailing from the second I got out of that house and hit the road…” I went on to explain all of my adventures- the gist of them anyways. It’s impossible for me to sum up the experience of the past two years. The only thing that comes close, I think, is the work I did that put me there in the first place. I’ve done my best to paint the picture of the world I saw with the words I published along the way. I recounted the mad scientists from Silicon Valley, to MIT, to Los Alamos who want the robots to take over the universe. I interviewed the crazy conspiracy theorists trying to uncover their work and overthrow the government from all over and even anonymously online. I mentioned the middle-ground of the two, the “woo woo” who just wanna do research to try to expand consciousness or unlock the 5th dimension under the governments nose or something. The last group led me to some fun, and I got a little carried away, but I never lost sight of my writing. I spent some time interviewing some Colorado jam bands and ski bums, which led to my whole art excursion, taking me to from California to New York in search of artists, musicians, authors, poets, and photographers- all people who seem to share the same mission as each other and me, only in different fonts. “… In short, I got to see a good chunk of the world, and somehow managed to capture a bit of it in my writing.  
</p><p>
All this reflecting is building a sort of image in my head, one so foggy that it feels almost archetypical, but with a little focus becomes so undeniably coherent. So tangible that I almost feel guilty for having lost it amidst the wilderness of my imagination. All of my adventures, when put on display like this, looks and feels unmistakably like my childhood room. Well, it does and doesn’t. In all of my writing projects and time around the science nerds, I see my old desk made out of paint cans and drywall that I labored at over computer science, physics, and creative writing in my free time. In the sloppy maintenance of and modifications on the van, I see my array of measly plants that never grew too tall. I see the toys scattered around my room from my restless dog that I never seemed to walk enough. In all of the friends I’ve met and stories heard along the way, I see my favorite artists and authors that I studied so intently as a kid. I see my bookshelf with stories that I loved and wanted to see for myself. In the art that I chased, I see my old walls. One plastered with band and TV posters. Opposite to that was a physical representation of my sketchbook and art from my friends. One was dedicated to my favorite vinyl records like trophies. My ceiling was covered with tapestries that I liked to look at when I was thinking about all these big ideas in some “woo woo” state of mind. I see my music corner with my cheap electric guitar and the keyboard that I never got great at. 
</p><p>
It wasn’t much, but it was my room; it was me. And my life now only proves that the essence of the objects that it consisted of were immaterial: infinite, immortal, magical, surreal. If those words could be used to describe anything at all it’d be that room. I see, looking back, that I really haven’t changed much. I think kid me would be proud of me now; not to say that I’m not still a kid. To be fair, it’s only thanks to the shelter, curiosity, and time that that space provided me with growing up that allowed me to fearlessly say goodbye to it in the first place to go on to create the life I have now. That room was filled with all of my favorite canvases. Now I’m able to see the world as my canvas, waiting to be painted with my presence as I attempt to create something beautiful with this thing of life. And there’s only more to come.

“Ready for part two of the story” Lilly asked with that familiar, inspiring grin that allowed me to see it all so clearly. 
</p><p>
“I could ask you the same. You’re coming with this time.”
