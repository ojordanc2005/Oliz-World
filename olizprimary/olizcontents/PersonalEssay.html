The origin of the word “Kosmos” comes from the Greeks and was used to describe an orderly and harmonious arrangement. The term was later adopted by Pythagoras to describe the Universe at large- people, Earth, and unknown included. As we see through the ego-centric errors presented in the Ptolemaic model of the universe, the Kosmos was far from other-worldly and was meant to describe a place in which we as people belong. I think this can be extended to say that the Greeks saw the stars and world around them as embedded with an implicit coherence and beauty that they sought to describe in the various languages of their sciences, philosophy, and art- all of which were indistinguishable at the time. The Greeks knew physics as the study of the world as they saw it, and as we now know, one inseparable from their humanity. The study of physics has given me a Kosmos that I’d like to share with the world. </p>

If I wanted to take advantage of the pathos inherent in my situation, I would write about experiencing discrimination as an LGBTQ woman in STEM, my developmental period of confusion and anxiety before my autism was validated, or coping with both of my parents’ drug addictions from a young age along with the poverty and neglect that resulted from it. That’s not to say that those experiences haven’t shaped who I am today, but that’s not the story I want to write. My story is one where I’ve found my curiosity and studies as a domain and language through which I’ve been able to act and find an independence. Physics has empowered me with the problem-solving capabilities that allow me to cope with adversity and create my individuality; envisioning and participating in a place where I belong and consequentially motivating me with an unwavering pursuit of the knowledge describing our Kosmos that I believe can inspire others like me. </p>

That being said, like the Greeks, I find it difficult to remove a humanity from my subject. Within or without academia, it is my core intent to continue my study of what I believe to be the neatest and most rigorous exploration of nature that humanity’s put forward thus far. However, I find repeatedly that the joy of learning is best achieved when it’s shared with others. Through determination, collaboration, communication, and a playful spirit, it is my upmost aim to be able to share the wonder, awe, and empowerment that the study of physics has given me. Whether through self-study, collaborative research, or scientific communication by teaching, throughout my pursuits I will maintain the goal of contributing to our collective comprehension and appreciation of the beautiful Kosmos we inhabit.
