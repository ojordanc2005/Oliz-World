        		The Heat Death of the Universe is, in short, the idea that all the energy in the universe will eventually transform into a useless soup of thermal energy in equilibrium- a state of maximum entropy and complete disorder incapable of storing any information. It’s depressing regardless of how nice you word it, but it’s inevitable. Even if you can shove the death of the universe to the back of your mind, consoling yourself with the fact that you’ll die long before then, it’s hard to avoid the concept of entropy in your lifetime. In a way, I think that you can find reconciliation with it in the fact that it’s inevitable alone. On one hand, it gives the impression that everything we do is futile because it all ends up the same in the end, with any comprehensible information stored in the world through our actions erased in the sweeping decay brought by this law based on the math that makes up our universe. It makes me feel small in the grand scheme of things. I wish I could ask the universe how it feels about its death. But in some sense, it makes me feel as though I have the universe in the palm of my hand. My feelings about it, although differing depending on how I woke up that morning, remind me that I am- that humanity is- a microcosm (quite literally) of the bigger picture of the universe. It’s a source of both hope and despair for me- the inevitability of it. The fact that I have any feelings towards this idea alone, remind me of the brighter side. This helpless tug of war with the laws that allow us to exist in the first place remind me of humanity. We’re imperfect and mortal, but it doesn’t stop us from living in the first place, regardless of what you make of your life. But on top of that, the fact that we can experience joy, see beauty, and feel love at the same time as we’re spiraling toward impending doom is proof, I think, that our existence is far from futile.</p> 
	<p>Steven Pinker put it optimistically that “The Second Law defines the ultimate purpose of life, mind, and human striving. To deploy energy and information to fight back the tide of entropy and carve out refuges of beneficial order. An underappreciation of the inherent tendency toward disorder, and a failure to appreciate the precious niches of order we carve out are a major source of human folly.” And I think I can agree with him on a good day.</p>
	<p>The mechanisms that make up physicists minds in our desire for a uniform, universal, pretty way to sum up the mess of what’s going on in this thing of the universe, I think, are tough but fun and humbling to mesh with philosophical ideas like this, so I applaud your willingness to put work into the system of your mind in regard to your and your students’ understanding of this concept with the goal of carving out a niche of reduced entropy in a way that’s meaningful to you and us. Thinking about it like that makes it not so bad, I think. Cause what else are we gonna do but keep going?</p>
<p>(see next page for my half-baked ramblings)</p>
	<p>I’ve come to understand the Big Bang in some sense *excuse my cosmological ignorance* as a sort of chance thing that would happen one in infinity years. Reconciling this with the notion that, without any mortal fleshling observers to complain about how long it would take, the fact that it’s possible to occur makes it essentially inevitable. I think the concept of entropy can be used here in the sense that the entropy of that system would tell you how likely it’d be that the Big Bang would occur at any given instant. However, without observers to experience it, time is essentially meaningless here. Similarly, without the increase of entropy, the arrow of time becomes undefined by our standards and… meaningless! Therefore, if there’s any chance at all that the big bang would occur, regardless of how small or how long it would take, coupled with the abandonment of the arrow of time, it follows that the Big Bang, under those conditions, would occur seemingly instantaneously. So maybe it’s cyclical and The Heat Death of The Universe can also be seen as the cold birth or something. Maybe universal expansion is just a sort of slow distribution of energy tending toward equilibrium. Maybe the Big Bang was just one out of a couple of other states that could’ve occurred, and maybe a Big Blomp or something has or will happen after another 5 cycles of heat death. IDK maybe I just don’t want the universe to die.</p>
